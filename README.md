How to tram the bed of the Sovol Zero 3D printer
------------------------------------------------

The goal is to be able to rotate both left and right lead-screws freely and separately from each other.
That way you can rotate them until both blocks are pinched between bed and x gantry. Then the bed is level from left to right.

- turn off power and remove glass top and the metal bottom plate.
- tilt/turn the printer in a way you can easily reach belt and see the blocks (I just tilted and have it rest on the spool holder)


Pictures with instructions:

A. 
- place blocks on both sides of extruder on X gantry

B. 
- you can move belt to lift bed upwards to X gantry if you want but this is how it will look after step D. below

C. 
Step 1) and 2) ONLY WHEN NEEDED!
I was able to just remove the belt from idler 3) by hand without loosening or removing any screw! Does not need much force.

1) loosen circled screws, no need to remove them
2) loosen screw (use the channel following the arrow)
   for me it was not needed to remove it but I completely loosened the screw
3) (push the idler left from 1) a bit to the left to release belt tension so that you can) remove the belt from idler 3)

D. 
- with the belt removed from idler 3) you are now able to rotate both lead-screws independently by hand until both blocks are pinched between bed and and x gantry


Finishing touches:

- put back belt around idler 3)
- (put back screw 2) if you loosened it completely from the hole)
- (tighten all screws)
- create new heightmap (http://<printer-ip>/heightmap) and verify if deviation is better 
- when happy with results put back bottom plate etc

--> now your bed should be level from left to right in parallel to the x gantry of the printer

E.
- idea for front to back tramming by shimming (washers or printed shims) in corners where bed is mounted to z lead-screws with 2 screws in each corner
  tightening/loosening them has some effect but with the speed this printer is capable of, I would rather not have loosened screws
