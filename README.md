The goal is to be able to rotate both left and right lead screws freely and separately from each other.
That way you can rotate them until both blocks are pinched between bed and bottom of frame. Then the bed is level from left to right.

- turn off power and remove glass top and the metal bottom plate.
- tilt/turn the printer in a way you can easily reach belt and see the blocks (I just tilted and have it rest on the spool holder)

A. remove plate from bed and place blocks on both sides

B. move belt to lower bed to bottom, blocks will rest on bottom frame

C.  1) loosen circled screws, no need to remove them
    2) loosen screw (use the channel following the arrow)
       for me it was not needed to remove it but I completely loosened the screw
    3) push the idler left from 1) a bit so that you can remove the belt from idler 3)

D. with the belt removed from idler 3) you are able to rotate both lead screws by hand until both blocks are pinched between bed and bottom --> level
